# CountryInfo App

***CountryInfo*** is a **Next.js/Node.js** application developed as part of an assessment for ***DevelopsToday***.

The **client** folder contains the ***Next.js app***, which runs on port 3000.

The **server** folder contains the ***Node.js backend***, which runs on port 4000.

By default, country data is stored in a .json file to optimize client-side performance. This approach allows the data to be loaded once and remain readily available for subsequent requests, improving overall load times.

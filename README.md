# CountryInfo App

***CountryInfo*** is a **Next.js/Node.js**

The app offers users an interactive interface to explore data such as population, area, language and more. It includes filtering features and is designed to be responsive across all devices.

The **client** folder contains the ***Next.js app***, which runs on port 3000.

The **server** folder contains the ***Node.js backend***, which runs on port 4000.

By default, country data is stored in a .json file to optimize client-side performance. This approach allows the data to be loaded once and remain readily available for subsequent requests, improving overall load times.
